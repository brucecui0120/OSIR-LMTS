# OSIR-LMTS（Open Source Influence Ranking of Large Model Technology Stack）

This project aims to establish a systematic framework for evaluating the open-source impact of large model technology ecosystems. By defining scientific and actionable evaluation criteria, we strive to help developers, researchers, and enterprises better understand and assess the practical value of these systems. Our approach focuses on four key technical dimensions: data, models, systems, and evaluation platforms.



## **Evaluation Dimensions**

The evaluation framework includes the following dimensions:

- **Data Dimension:** Includes dataset coverage, large model lifecycle coverage, and data processing tools as evaluation criteria.
- **Model Dimension:** Includes metrics such as model usage, modality coverage, model size, contributor activity, and openness of the models.
- **System Dimension:** Focuses on operator libraries, parallel training and inference frameworks, deep learning frameworks, and contributor activity.
- **Evaluation Platform Dimension:** Covers evaluation leaderboards, models, data, and methods.



This comprehensive coverage of the dimensions of the large-model technology ecosystem ensures the evaluation framework's systematic and scientific rigor in assessing the open-source impact of large-model technologies.

## **Data Sources and Evaluation Methods**

### **Data Sources:**

- **Data Dimension:** GitHub, Hugging Face, ModelScope, OpenI, OpenDataLab, Google official website, META official website, Google Search, and other platforms.
- **Model Dimension:** Hugging Face, ModelScope, GitHub, OpenI, etc.
- **System Dimension:** GitHub/DIOPI, GitHub/BladeDISC, GitHub/PyTorch, Paddle, Mindspore, TensorFlow, etc.
- **Evaluation Platform Dimension:** Hugging Face, GitHub, Gitee, and official websites of various organizations.

## **Statistical Methods**

- Download-related data reflects the statistics of downloads within the current month, while other data represents the cumulative value as of the end of the month.
- A total of 44 indicators were obtained from 7,025 links.
- The data collection period is around the 15th of each month, with the last data collection occurring on November 15, 2024.

## Calculation Method

All metrics are normalized using the Min-Max method, and the influence score is calculated as the average of the normalized values.

## **Engagement and Feedback**

We encourage active participation from the community.The public announcement period is from December 16, 2024, to January 16, 2025.
